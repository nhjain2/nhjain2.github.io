    <h1 class="titles">Comparing the Fuel Efficiency of Gas and Electric Cars</h1>
    <div class="text-container">
        <p class="intro">
            Practicing sustainability and protecting the environment have never been more important. Vehicle emissions are a large contributor to air pollution and climate change. 
            Being conscious of this and choosing fuel-efficient cars can help reduce the impact on the environment. In this interactive slideshow, we will explore sample data on 
            cars from 2017. We will focus on the fuel type, average city MPG, and average highway MPG of each car, and we will use these values to compare gas/diesel and electric 
            cars. Which are the most fuel-efficient?
